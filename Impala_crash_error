TSB 2018-275: Impala crashes or returns incorrect results on Xeon Skylake-SP processors with AVX-512 support
Labels:

Summary
A third-party library used by Impala has various bugs with its AVX-512 support that cause incorrect results or crashes when running Impala queries with codegen enabled.
Symptoms
Intel recently released Xeon server-class processors that support the AVX-512 instruction set extensions. A third-party library used by Impala has various bugs with its AVX-512 support that cause incorrect results or crashes when running Impala queries with codegen enabled.

Impact: Incorrect results or Impala daemon crashes.
Users affected: All Impala users with the affected hardware.
Applies To
CDH 5.8.0, 5.8.2, 5.8.3, 5.8.4, 5.8.5
CDH 5.9.0, 5.9.1, 5.9.2, 5.9.3
CDH 5.10.0, 5.10.1, 5.10.2
CDH 5.11.0, 5.11.1, 5.11.2
CDH 5.12.0, 5.12.1, 5.12.2
CDH 5.13.0, 5.13.1
Instructions
To obtain the fix, upgrade to CDH 5.14.0 or higher.

To determine if your CPU is affected, run "cat /proc/cpuinfo" on the system and inspect the "flags" field. If any flags starting with avx512* are listed, your system is affected.

For example, C5 and M5 instance families in AWS EC2 are affected.

If you plan to run Impala on hardware with an affected processor, two remediations are possible:

Upgrade to CDH5.14.0 and higher with the fix for IMPALA-6291.
If Impala is running under virtualization and your virtualization software can disable instruction set extensions via CPUID, disable any extensions starting with “avx512” on the guest VM.
It is possible to work around the issue by setting the query option disable_codegen=true for all queries, but this comes at a significant performance penalty.
