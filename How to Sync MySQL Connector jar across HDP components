Helpful command to track down all mysql-connector binaries on cluster node (and run md5sum to confirm version) 
find / -xdev -type f -name "mysql-connector*jar" | xargs md5sum


This article uses mysql-connector-java-5.1.35-bin.jar as example. Version later works as well.

 

1. The best solution is to house the primary mysql-connector jar file (mysql-connector-java-5.1.35-bin.jar) in: 
/usr/share/java

 

2. Create a symlink in that directory called point to the 5.1.35 binary:


mysql-connector-java.jar -> /usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java-5.1.35-bin.jar

 

3. Stop all related HDP services that will be using the new mysql-connector jar via Ambari.

 

4. Create symlinks (or copy the binary) over to all the locations above, making sure the name is exactly: 
mysql-connector-java.jar

 

5. Start the HDP components affected by the change via Ambari

 

6. Stop the Ambari-agent


service ambari-agent stop

 

7. Cleanup Ambari-agent cache directories of any leftover mysql*jar files 
/var/lib/ambari-agent/tmp 
/var/lib/ambari-agent/cache

 

8. Run the following Ambari-server command to update the mysql-connector jar:

ambari-server setup --jdbc-db=mysql --jdbc-driver=/usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar

 

9. Restart ambari-server and start back up the ambari-agent 
service ambari-server restart 
service ambari-agent start

 

8. Recheck the mysql-connector md5sums:


find / -xdev -type f -name "mysql-connector*jar" -o -name "mysql-jdbc*.jar" | xargs md5sum 
find / -xdev -type l -name "mysql-connector*jar" -o -name "mysql-jdbc*.jar" | xargs md5sum

 

Confirm the connector used by each component:


Sample (Hive Metastore and Hiveserver2)
lsof -p $(cat /var/run/hive/hive-server.pid) | grep mysql 
lsof -p $(cat /var/run/hive/hive.pid) | grep mysql

 

Side note: Ambari creates a differently named symlink 'mysql-jdbc-driver.jar' instead of mysql-connector-java.jar in /var/lib/amari-server/resources. Please do not modify this filename.
