1. Login as bedrock service user

su - bedrock

 

2. create file /home/bedrock/renewKerberos.sh and write below contents into the file

 

#!/bin/bash

kfile=$( klist 2>/dev/null |sed '/cache:/!d;s/^.*:\(.*\)$/\1/')

if [ -z "$kfile" ]

then

kinit -kt /home/bedrock/bedrock/.keytab bedrock/@TESTAD.COM

else

kinit -R -c $kfile

fi

#End of File

 

3. Provide execute permissions

 

chmod +x /home/bedrock/renewKerberos.sh

 

4. Now on commandline as bedrock user run crontab -e 

 

$ crontab -e 

 

5. enter below line and save the crontab file

 

0 1,13 * * * /home/bedrock/renewKerberos.sh 

 

6. Check if the entry is present by running below command

 

crontab -l

 

7. Done. Cron job runs at 1 am and 1 pm to renew tickets.

 

P.S:

If we already donâ€™t have valid kerberos credentials, we need to run the "kinit -kt /home/bedrock/bedrock/.keytab bedrock/@TESTAD.COM/ " for the first time as the cron job will run at specific time and until then you won't have bedrock credentials.

Hi Raja,

 

We already have kstart linux package to renew Kerberos ticket.

 

 

Step 1. yum install kstart

Step 2. Using the keytab file for the Bedrock user copied over from the KDC server earlier 

[bedrock@bedrock-server ~]$ k5start -b -L -l 60m -K 30 -f /absolute/path/to/bedrock.keytab -U

Flags:
   -b          = run as a daemon / in the bg
   -L          = Log messages via syslog (/var/log/messages for CentOS) as well as stderr 
   -l 60m      = Ask for a ticket lifetime of 60 min (could be anything under the max configured ticket lifetime in kdc.conf)
   -K 30       = Keep ticket alive indefinitely. Check/init/renew ticket every 30 min 
   -f <path>   = path to keytab
   -U          = Use the first principal in the keytab as the client principal

 

k5start runs as a daemon process in background.

 

NOTE:

    1. k5start will manage both kinit and krenew for this principal to ensure Bedrock account had a valid, un-expired ticket
    2. Make sure to use the absolute path for the keytab file to avoid renewal errors past the configured "maxrenewlife" time.
